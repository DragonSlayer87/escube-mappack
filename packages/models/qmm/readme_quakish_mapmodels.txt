copyright stuff

Just follow the license of the mapmodel wich you want to use for any project.
- You are not allowed to change a file within the zip file.
- You are not allowed to change anything to a mapmodel wich doesnt has any license. In that case, you need permission of the author who set up the hole modelpack (wich is me).
- You are allowed to change anything of a mapmodel, but only if the license of it permits. Do not forget a readme-file isnt a license, exept if it contains licensing info (like this readme-file)!
- You are allowed to change any md3.cfg file of any mapmodel, even of those who doesnt have a license...
- You are allowed to give the person ("Suicizer") wich set up this modelpack a credit, but you dont have to if you really dont want too (still get preciated)...
