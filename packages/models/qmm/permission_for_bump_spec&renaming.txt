    Dear Yves,
    I've seen your creations of modeling and was wondering if I could add (seperate) specular and bumpmaps to models that have a license wich said the skin shouldnt be used as base for other skins.
    Because those specular and bumpmapped skins have to be based from the original skin, I would like to ask if I got permission to make those specular and bumpmaps for those models (like "el_generator", "elspawn", "elglight2", etc), so I can use them to create a modelpack for Cube Engine 2...
    Another question is,
    Can I rename skins and models too?

    Thanks already.

    With kind regards,

    Suicizer.
